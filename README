This repository contains a set of plugins that I have created for the Javac compiler. Much of these
plugins aim to increase functionality and the ability for the user to define certain functionalities
based on certain compilation params. However, there are certain limitations within the compiler
itself that can also influence how things can work and how certain pragmas can be called be
between source and compiler. For example, you cannot simply leech a macro find and replace tool
onto Javac's annotation parsing phase, instead you most definitely need to either:
      1. Write a parser that handles the macros beforehand and then invokes the Javac compiler
      2. Write a precheck for Javac that is ran in the first cycle of the Javac compilation life
         cycle. [This however, heavily depends on Javac implementation]

In general, you should not depend on these plugins to make Java much more friendlier, instead, it
is probably far less problematic to use a different language. Additionally, plugins here can
break at any time due to inconsistent source file versions and other different stuffs between
JDK providers and Javac implementations.
